No Interrupt Cycle - Summary and Explanation

## 1. Overview of No Interrupt Cycle
- In a **No Interrupt** system, the **CPU continuously checks** whether an I/O operation is complete instead of performing other tasks.
- This is called **polling**, where the CPU repeatedly asks the I/O device if it has finished its operation.
- The CPU **cannot execute other tasks** while waiting, making this process inefficient.

## 2. Execution Flow in a No Interrupt Cycle
The process follows these steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **User Program Executes** ‚Üí CPU runs normal instructions.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **WRITE Command Issued** ‚Üí CPU sends a request for an I/O operation.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **CPU Waits (Polling for I/O Completion)** ‚Üí Instead of performing other tasks, the CPU keeps checking if I/O is done.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **I/O Command Processed** ‚Üí The I/O operation is executed.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **I/O Complete** ‚Üí CPU detects that the operation is finished.  
6Ô∏è‚É£ **Program Counter (PC) Updates** ‚Üí Moves to the next instruction.  
7Ô∏è‚É£ **Decision Point:**  
   - If the next instruction is another WRITE ‚Üí Go back to step 2 (**loop begins**).  
   - If the program ends ‚Üí Execution stops.

## 3. Why Does the Execution Go Back to the First WRITE?
The instruction moves back to the first WRITE if the **program is designed as a loop**.

- If the program reaches **END**, the **Program Counter (PC) updates** to the next instruction.  
- If the program is a **loop**, the next instruction after END will be the **first WRITE command again**, repeating the process.  
- If the program is **not a loop**, execution stops at END.  

### üîπ Analogy: A Waiter in a Restaurant üçΩÔ∏è
- The waiter **takes an order** ‚Üí (**WRITE Command Issued**).  
- The waiter **waits for the chef to cook** ‚Üí (**CPU Polling for I/O**).  
- The waiter **serves the food** ‚Üí (**I/O Complete**).  
- If more customers exist, the waiter **takes another order** ‚Üí (**Loop Back to First WRITE**).  
- If no customers remain, the waiter **stops working** ‚Üí (**Program Ends**).

## 4. Role of the Program Counter (PC) in a Loop
- The **PC is still active in a loop**, but instead of moving forward permanently, it **jumps back to the first WRITE instruction** to repeat the process.  
- **Analogy: A Train on a Circular Track üöÜ**
  - Each **station = an instruction**.  
  - The train moves **station by station (PC updating step by step).**  
  - When it reaches the last station (**END**), it **loops back** to the first station (**first WRITE command**), repeating the cycle.  
  - The cycle **continues until the loop condition changes.**

## 5. Key Takeaways
‚úÖ The CPU **cannot perform other tasks** while waiting for I/O (polling).  
‚úÖ The **WRITE command repeats in a loop** if the program is structured that way.  
‚úÖ The **PC is effective but keeps updating to loop back** to the first WRITE command.  
‚úÖ If the program has no loop, execution stops after END.  
‚úÖ **Loop analogy**: Waiter taking orders / Train on a circular track.

## 6. When Does the Process Stop?
‚ùå The process stops **only when there are no more instructions left** after END.  
‚ùå If the program is designed as a loop, execution **never stops** unless explicitly programmed to exit.  

---

## ‚úÖ Final Conclusion
The **No Interrupt cycle is inefficient** because the CPU **wastes time checking I/O status instead of executing other tasks**.  
In modern systems, **interrupt-based I/O is preferred** to avoid this problem.
